### The goal of this "exam" was to work through common exploratory data analysis processes in order to answer these questions: 
#### 1. What routes are "similar" to each other? What makes them "similar" to one-another? 
#### 2. How were routes impacted by COVID? Did some suffer more than others? Did some routes recover better than others? 
#### 3. Is Amtrak becoming more or less reliable as a method of transportation?
#### 4. How has ridership changed across different states in different years? How is Amtrak meeting (or failing to meet) this demand with regular daily trips? 
### The final submission included an ipynb file of jupyter notebook code, and a 3 page maximum report of findings and visualizations to an audience that has limited statistical knowledge.
